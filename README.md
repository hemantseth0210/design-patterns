Dependency Inversion Principle

There are two parts in this principle
- High-Level modules should not depend on the Low-Level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
- Abstraction should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstraction.

## Factory Method
The Factory Method patterns defines an interface for creating an object, but lets the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
